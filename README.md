## ðŸ”¹ How to Use Branches

- **main** â†’ Final demo-ready code (Stable)  
- **dev** â†’ Testing branch (all features merged here first)  
- **feat/contracts** â†’ Smart Contracts (N + Amit)  
- **feat/frontend** â†’ Next.js UI (M)  
- **feat/backend** â†’ Firebase backend (K)  
- **feat/docs** â†’ Documentation + PPTs (Amit + helpers)  


### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/blockchain-voting-zkp.git
cd blockchain-voting-zkp

git checkout feat/contracts

**### 2. Create or Switch to Your Branch**

If you are starting new work (branch doesnâ€™t exist yet):
git checkout -b feat/contracts

If branch already exists (already pushed to GitHub):
git checkout feat/contracts

### 3. Always Pull Latest Changes Before Working
git pull origin dev

### 4. Make Your Changes

Do your coding or documentation. Then save and commit:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added castVote function"

### 5. Push Your Branch to GitHub
git push origin feat/contracts

### 6. Open a Pull Request (PR)

Go to GitHub â†’ Pull Requests â†’ New Pull Request

Compare your branch (feat/...) â†’ merge into dev

Add description (what you did + tested)

Assign reviewer (Amit or N)

### 7. Final Merge

Amit merges dev â†’ main only when stable.

main must always stay demo-ready.
